# Hi, I'm Kara ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **UX Engineer**, **Full-Stack Web Developer**, and **Product Designer** with a unique blend of skills that transcend traditional boundaries. I bridge the gap between **design**, **development**, and **business strategy** to create user-centric solutions that meet real-world challenges.

## ðŸš€ About Me
Hello! I'm Kara, a versatile and forward-thinking UX Engineer with a unique blend of skills that transcend traditional boundaries.

#### STRATEGIC APPROACH
With a foundation in Engineering Management and experience in business and project management, I bring a strategic perspective to everything I do. I thrive on crafting design and development solutions that meet user needs while aligning with broader business objectives.

#### GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
For the past few years, Iâ€™ve called Barcelona home, immersing myself in a vibrant culture and gaining insights into diverse user perspectives. This experience has deepened my ability to design with empathy, creating solutions that resonate across cultures.

#### BRIDGING DISCIPLINES
My journey began in controls engineering, where I first developed a curiosity for development. That curiosity evolved into a passion for UX/UI design, and most recently, full-stack development. My hands-on training in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and responsive web design has positioned me as a professional who bridges the gap between design, development, and strategy.

#### JOURNEY TO UX ENGINEERING
I recently completed a rigorous full-stack web development program that equipped me with skills in front-end and back-end technologies. From creating dynamic, responsive applications to deploying full-stack solutions, Iâ€™ve built a strong technical foundation to complement my design expertise. My goal is to merge these skills into UX engineering roles that combine creative vision with robust technical execution.

#### EMPOWERING TRANSFORMATION
I thrive on solving complex problems and collaborating with cross-functional teams. My multidisciplinary background enables me to bridge the gaps between design, engineering, and business, ensuring that projects are user-focused and technically sound.

#### USER-CENTRIC PHILOSOPHY
For me, itâ€™s all about the user. Whether designing intuitive interfaces or coding seamless interactions, Iâ€™m driven by a passion for creating solutions that enhance experiences and solve real-world challenges.
